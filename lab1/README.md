# Overview
In this lab, you will create a simple Classroom Management System using Flask - a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python.

We will use Postman to make API requests to the webapp to create and view objects. Objects will be stored in a SQLite database.

Finally, we will demonstrate how to use DBeaver, a database management tool, to interact with the SQLite database.

# Installation
## Softwares
See `postman/` and `dbeaver/` for instructions to install Postman and DBeaver.

## Python dependencies
1. Clone this repo, and create a virtual environment TBD
2. Install flask
3. Go to `classroom-management`, and start the webapp

# Steps
1. Follow instructions under `postman/` to make a few POST requests that will create and store classroom objects in a SQLite database
2. Follow instructions under `dbeaver/` to connect to the database and perform some operations
