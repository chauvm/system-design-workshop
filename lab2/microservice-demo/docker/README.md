1. Download Docker for Desktop: https://www.docker.com/get-started/.

Docker Desktop includes the following components:
- Docker Engine: It is the core component of Docker Desktop that manages the creation, running, and management of Docker containers on your computer.
- Docker CLI client: It provides a command-line interface to interact with the Docker Engine, allowing you to execute commands such as creating, starting, and managing containers.
- Docker Buildx: It is an extension that accelerates the image building process.
- Docker Compose: It enables you to define and run multi-container applications using a YAML configuration file.
- Kubernetes: It is an open-source container orchestration platform that helps automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Docker Desktop includes a built-in Kubernetes feature for local development and testing.
- ... and more

After you install Docker Desktop and open it for the first time, you can use tutorials in its Learning Center to understand What is a Container and its properties.


2. Turn on Kubernetes
